# Role playbook

>This documents converting the *intermediate playbook* in the basic playbook folder into the *roleplaybook* and adding roles to it to make it more readable.



## Combining Roles 
In this example we have a webserver role then we have a role for installing the flask web application. <br/>
These are seperate roles that are combined to get the website running. <br/>
We could even have a role for installing an sql database ect.<br/>
